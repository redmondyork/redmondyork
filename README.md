**__About my duplicates__**

I am unfortunately locked out of my old account(s). If you wanna know why, ask Swisscows why they made an email provider service, and then after 2 years decided to 
depretiate and lockout users on their 'free tier'... I'm not paying for a service I spend all of 5 minutes on per week. I similarly lost access to an older account
when the 'up and coming' email provider in the Skiff productivity suite was bought out by Notion, who then said "whats this email part? No need for that" and all 
data was deleted and service discontinued (thanks Obama). So THIS is the github I use (for now), let's just hope AOL's email service exists forever. People keep 
recommending I use Gmail, but I havn't even used Fmail yet, and I don't just go skipping entire alphabetical letters all 'willy-nilly' like that. You can call me
oldschool, just don't call me for fronts.
